## Contributing
When beginning work on a new feature:
1. Create a new branch off of `dev`.
2. Develop on this branch until the feature is complete.
3. Merge any changes from `dev` into the branch.
4. Create a pull request into `dev` for the feature, filling out the provided template.
5. When `dev` is stable, create a pull request for `dev` into `main`.

**NOTE**: If your feature requires any changes to a scene, before beginning development on the feature you should duplicate 
the scene in question. While working on the feature, you should only make changes to this scene, and not the original. Once you 
are ready to create the pull request, merge in any changes from the `main` branch as normal, and *only then* should you copy your 
changes back into  the original scene. This will prevent merge conflicts in scenes, which can be extremely difficult to resolve otherwise.
